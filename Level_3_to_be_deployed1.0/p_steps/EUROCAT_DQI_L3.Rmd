**EUROCAT: Definition of Data Quality Indicators**

<br> 

The aim of [EUROCAT](https://eu-rd-platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu/eurocat_en) is to carry out epidemiological surveillance of congenital anomalies in Europe. Congenital anomaly registers are established to facilitate the identification of teratogenic exposures, for the planning and evaluation of preventive health services and to provide a mechanism for the audit of prenatal screening practice.     
Complex factors influence the quality of data collected by a congenital anomaly registry. Registry data are never a “perfect” description of which babies have congenital anomalies in the population and precisely what those anomalies are. [Data Quality Indicators](https://eu-rd-platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/Full_Guide_1_4_version_28_DEC2018.pdf) (DQI) have been proposed and are freely available. These indicators will allow registries to evaluate their performance in relation to other registries, and will allow appropriate interpretations to be made of the results of data analyses. The DQI of a particular registry can be compared to the EUROCAT average. Strong deviations on either side of the average should be examined. The set of data quality indicators has been produced under the headings:   
1. Ascertainment    
2. Accuracy of Diagnosis    
3. Completeness of Information     
4. Timeliness   
5. Denominator Information

## 6. EUROCAT Algorithm

<br>

Definition of a multiple congenital anomaly case (MCA):    
Two or more unrelated major structural malformations that cannot be explained by an underlying syndrome or sequence.   
This means that the process of the flowchart is to find cases with two or more codes within the Q chapter, unless the case is transferred to other groups according to the steps described below.     
Name for groups:    
C: chromosomal      
B: genetic syndrome, skeletal dysplasia and monogenic disorder    
N: NTD isolated      
A: isolated cardiac     
R: isolated renal    
I: isolated other     
O: non-syndrome outside malformation chapter     
M: potential multiple anomalies     
T: teratogenic syndrome    

**Minor, unspecified and invalid codes.**   
The following codes are ignored in the flowchart, but appear in individual case output: Guide 1.4 list of minors post 2005 to be used for all years.   
Balanced chromosomal rearrangements (7584 or Q95) as the only code Multiple Malformation code (7597 or Q897).   
Unspecified malf code (7599 or Q899)   
No valid ICD code    
Group X contains cases with only the above-listed codes.    

**Outside Q-chapter codes (except the few codes accepted in “all anomalies”)**
These codes are ignored by the flowchart process but appear in the individual case output Accepted non Q codes: D215, D821, D1810, P350, P351, P371
ICD/BPA9: 27910, 2281, 76076, 76280, 7710, 7711, 77121

**The flowchart**
For 3 and 4 digit codes mentioned here, the coding also includes the codes with more digits Only Q-codes are valid for the process after step 2
